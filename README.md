## Project description
---------------------------------

1.

## Sensors and BOM
----------
* WIFI module for Arduino
	Further research will be necessary to find the right one. Ideally it will enable us to search for available networks and give us the strength of the signal.
* Magnet coil
	The basic element in creating the electromagnet necessary for any kind of speaker.
* Conductive thread
	A necessary element when integrating a circuit to a wearable. It could also be used to make speakers, but further experiments will be essential to create a sound that is loud enough.
* Fabric
	A thin, water resistant fabric works best.
