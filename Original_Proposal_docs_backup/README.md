## Project description
---------------------------------

1.The project is meant to confound and confuse recognition software and the human’s ability to recognize and associate individuals and their feature, as a comment on the intrusion of privacy and anonymity that occurs due to the omnipresence of cameras and recording devices. As a wearable, it can be worn and used at any time, but it’s core purpose is it working as a sort of countermeasure/critique against surveillance and impromptu recording of oneself.

2.For the user, it afford a new sense of anonymity, and the unique visual aspect of the mask attracts curiosity among people around him. Due to its shifting nature, however, capturing the individual’s likeliness (and coincidentally, the mask’s) becomes very difficult - read impossible - due to it constantly shifting shape, color, form , etc.

3.It helps the user remain anonymous, somewhat, and potentially could shield him from recognition software/unwanted recording should he be subject to it.

4.Facial recognition is a learning system - both on the software level and on the human level (as in, human associate faces with identity). By constantly interfering with facial appearance, we throw off that learning system. Thus somewhat protecting the user’s anonymity.

## Sensors and BOM
----------
* WIFI module for Arduino
	Further research will be necessary to find the right one. Ideally it will enable us to search for available networks and give us the strength of the signal.

- Inflating pads
    
- Led lights?
    
- Motors (moving parts, shifting form.)

Most of these project are simply practical in form - a lot of it coming straight out of the HK protests made this a necessity. We also would like to add an artistic and aesthetic value to our project, as well as add some level of protection against traditional methods of recording rather than only facial recognition software (like someone taking a picture of you without your knowing in public, and such).
